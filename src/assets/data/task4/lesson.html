Sometimes there is something excessive in the data that we would like to get rid of from the middle of the string
- this could be some operating system specific padding or some added identifier for example. There is a way to do
that with regex too. <br>
Remember that <strong>[0-9]</strong> would match any digit? Now if you want to do the opposite and match everything
but the digit you could simply add a <strong>^</strong>, the pattern would then become <strong>[^0-9]</strong>. You
could do the same with other characters too so if <strong>[abc]</strong> matches all letters a, b or c then
<strong>[^abc]</strong> matches anything but.

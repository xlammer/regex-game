    Sometimes there is something excessive in the data that we would like to get rid of from the middle of the string
    - this could be some operating system specific padding or some added identifier for example. There is a way to do
    that with regex too.

    Remember that <b>[0-9]</b> would match any digit? Now if you want to do the opposite and match everything
    but the digit you could simply add a <b>^</b>, the pattern would then become <b>[^0-9]</b>. You
    could do the same with other characters too so if <b>[abc]</b> matches all letters a, b or c then
    <b>[^abc]</b> matches anything but.

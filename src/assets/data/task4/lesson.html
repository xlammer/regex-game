    Regex is all about pattern matching and provides some nifty tools to filter out only values that contain
    information we know how to deal with. Sometimes we might know exactly how the word starts and ends and might not
    really care about the middle part.

    <b>^</b> indicates the start of a word, so if I use <b>^abc</b> then only words
    starting with letters <b>abc</b> would be matched. For ending, special character <b>$</b> is used.
    Should I use <b>abc$</b> then the word would need to end with said letters to qualify as a match.

<p> Dot is a special character that matches any single character (symbol). If I use a '<b>.</b>' in my expression then
    there could be letter <b><em>a</em></b> or there could be digit <b><em>5</em></b> at that spot it would still be a
    match.

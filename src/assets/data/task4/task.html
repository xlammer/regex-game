I read my data in from a file, but those pesky line end characters obstruct the processing of the lines. Get rid
of the line end characters (<strong>\n</strong>). Remember that they are at the end of the line! Also remember that
<strong>.</strong> matches every character? And that <strong>*</strong> is a special quantifier? Now might be
a good time to reuse those.<br>
NB! In a regular expression if you want to match <strong>\</strong> you would write <strong>\\</strong>. Regex treats
<strong>\</strong> a bit differently from normal letters and numbers.

Please enter the appropriate regular expression into the box bellow to see the results.

    I read my data in from a file, but those pesky line end characters obstruct the processing of the lines. Get rid
    of the line end characters (<b>\n</b>). Remember that they are at the end of the line! Also remember that <b>.</b>
    matches every character? And that <b>*</b> is a special quantifier? Now might be a good time to reuse those.

<p>NB! In a regular expression if you want to match <b>\</b> you would write <b>\\</b>. Regex treats<b>\</b> a bit
    differently from normal letters and numbers.

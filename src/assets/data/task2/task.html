    Regex may be used to filter some values. Let's assume we receive a string that represents code of a product in a
    supermarket. We would like to show only dairy products. We know that all dairy products have code in a form of <b>KD-XXXX</b>
    where X is any number. Let's solve the puzzle, shall we?

    In the results you should see only valid codes, filtered out codes are marked as <b>'Nothing matched.'</b>

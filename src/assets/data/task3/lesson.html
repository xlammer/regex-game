Regex is all about pattern matching and provides some nifty tools to filter out only values that contain
information we know how to deal with.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/html">
Sometimes we might know exactly how the word starts and ends and might not really care about the middle part.
<br>
<strong>^</strong> indicates the start of a word, so if I use <strong>^abc</strong> then only words
starting with letters abc would be matched. For ending, special character <strong>$</strong> is used.
Should I use <strong>abc$</strong> then the word would need to end with said letters to qualify as a match. <br>
Dot is a special character that matches anything. If I use a <strong>.</strong> in my expression then there could be
letter <em>a</em> or there could be digit <em>5</em> at that spot it would still be a match. <br>
What if I don't really care about the number of characters matching my pattern and I just want to match them all?
Well, glad you asked. This <strong>*</strong> is a special quantifier for this. Remember using
<strong>\d{4}</strong> to match 4digits? If you wanted to match any number of digits you could just use
<strong>\d*</strong>.<br>
<strong>NB!</strong> Our tests tuned so that regexp will not stop on first match and will check every single character whether it's a digit or not (regexp G flag is used).

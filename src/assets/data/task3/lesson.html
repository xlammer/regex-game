    There are some characters that regex treats as special, you have already seen a few, here is the full list:
    <b>. ^ $ * + ? ( [ { \ </b>. Remember that <b>[0-9]</b> would match any digit? Square brackets can also represents
    sets of characters to match from. So for example <b>[abc]</b> would match any of the characters within brackets -
    either <b>a</b>, <b>b</b> or <b>c</b> (not the whole word abc though).

<p> Dot '<b>.</b>' is a special regex character that matches any single character. If I use a '<b>.</b>' in my
    expression then there could be letter <b><em>a</em></b> or there could be digit <b><em>5</em></b> - any symbol would
    match at that spot. Expression <b>.*</b> (dot with asterisk), however, would match anything no matter how long input
    string is, this is a killer feature, you will need it :)

    There are some characters that regex treats special, you have already seen a few, here is the full list:
    <strong>.^$*+?()[{\|</strong> <br>
    Remember that <b>[0-9]</b> would match any digit? Well square brackets are special to regex too, you can use them to specify
    within what set of characters a match is. So for example <strong>[abc]</strong> would match any of the characters a, b
    and c. <br>
    <strong>.</strong> is another example, it is regex special way of saying anything - <strong>.</strong> matches any character
    not just <strong>.</strong> itself.

    Sometimes we want some data we collect to be at the same time human readable and also easy to process by computer. For
    this we might have some specific way of marking the parts of the text that are actually important or unique. We might
    even use characters that regex finds special too. <br>
    To try and match a special character, it first needs to be escaped by using a backslash. For example as said
    the <strong>.</strong> usually tells regex to match any character, so if I wanted to match a <strong>.</strong> and
    only that, I would use <strong>\.</strong> <br>

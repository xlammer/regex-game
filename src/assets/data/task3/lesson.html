Regex is all about pattern matching and provides some nifty tools to filter out only values that contain
information we know how to deal with.<br>
Sometimes we might know exactly how the word starts and ends and might not really care about the middle part.
<br>
<strong>^</strong> indicates the start of a word, so if I use <strong>^abc</strong> then only words
starting with letters abc would be matched. For ending, special character <strong>$</strong> is used.
Should I use <strong>abc$</strong> then the word would need to end with said letters to qualify as a match. <br>
Dot is a special case in regex and needs to be escaped, so if you wish to use it in your expression use
<strong>\.</strong> instead. <br>
There are many ways to communicate that you don't really care what character is next. <strong>\w</strong> for example
would match any letter or digit, but would not match a dot. <strong>\S</strong> would match letters, digits and
othe characters. <strong>\w</strong> and <strong>\S</strong> match a single character, to match multiple, you can add
+ so they become <strong>\w+</strong> and <strong>\S+</strong>.
<strong>NB!</strong> Our tests tuned so that regexp will not stop on first match and will check every single character whether it's a digit or not (regexp G flag is used).

    In the input strings we have logs of windows catalogs that are either added or removed and we'd like to extract only paths.

    To match a special character, it first needs to be escaped by using a backslash (<b>\</b>). For example as
    said the <b>.</b> usually tells regex to match any character, so if I wanted to match a <b>.</b> and only that, I
    would use <b>\.</b>

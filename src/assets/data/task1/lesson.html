Let's start from the simplest rule, probably :) Matching a digit. <br>
There are many cases in daily routines that require us working with integers that are for some reason trapped within a sequence of characters. Regex will help you find those digits.
<br>
In order to match a single digit you have to specify special character <strong>\d</strong> or use
<strong>[0-9]</strong> as regular expression pattern. It will match any number form your input string.<br>
<strong>NB!</strong> Our tests tuned so that regexp will not stop on first match and will check every single character whether it's a digit or not (regexp G flag is used).

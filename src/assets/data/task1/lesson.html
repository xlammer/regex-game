<p>Let's start from the simplest rule, probably :) Matching a digit.</p>
<p>
    There are many cases in daily routines that require us working with numbers that are for some reason trapped within
    a sequence of characters. Regex will help you find those numbers.
</p>
<p>
    In order to match a single digit you have to specify special character <strong>\d</strong> or use
    <strong>[0-9]</strong> as regular expression pattern. It will match only first digit it finds, to find following
    digits you should put asterisk (<b>*</b>) symbol right after your chosen regexp pattern for digits. Essentially it
    means look
    forward character by character until you reach non-digit or end of given string.

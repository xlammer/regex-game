<p>Let's start from the simplest rule, probably :) Matching a number.</p>
<p>
    There are many cases in daily routines that require us working with numbers that are for some reason trapped within
    a sequence of characters. Regex will help you find those numbers.

<p>
    In order to match a single digit you have to specify <b>\d</b> or use <b>[0-9]</b> as regular
    expression pattern. It will match only first digit it finds in the given string, to find also following digits you
    should put asterisk (<b>*</b>) symbol right after your chosen regexp pattern for digits. Essentially it means look
    forward character by character until you reach non-digit or end of the string.

<p>The last task is about putting it all together and adding something new to the table. You should already know
    quantifiers from task 2 and that they help matching exact number of symbols i.e <b>{3}</b> (only 3) or any in
    between like <b>{2,4}</b> (2,3 or 4).
</p>
<p>
    The first new expression for this task is alphabetical range. You may use range already in the first task, remember
    <b>[0-9]</b>? That is range that matches any digit from 0 to 9, but letters can be used as well i.e <b>[a-z]</b>
    will match any small letter from english alphabet and <b>[A-B]</b> will match only <b>A</b> or <b>B</b> (upper
    case).
</p>
<p>
    The second new expression is conditional special character in brackets. <b>(white|black)</b> will match either black
    or white.

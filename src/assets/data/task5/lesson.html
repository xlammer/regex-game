<p>The last task is about putting it all together. You should remember quantifiers and that they help matching exact
    number of symbols and setting boundaries. Click on 2nd task to check those out.
</p>
<p>The first new expression for this task is alphabetical range. You may use range already in the first task, remember
    <b>[0-9]</b>?
    That is range that matches any digit from 0 to 9, but letters can be used as well i.e <b>[a-z]</b> will match any
    small letter from english alphabet and <b>[A-B]</b> will match only <b>A</b> or <b>B</b> (upper case).
</p>
<p>The second new expression is conditional special character in brackets. <b>(white|black)</b> will match either black
    or white.
